The main purpose of this module is to provide batch access to
http://heasarc.nasa.gov/ catalogue database from within python scripts. It
can be used, however as standalone tool as well. the call sequence is:

browse_extract table, position, radius=30, output="text_table|pdf",
resolver="SIMBAD|NED",Time="", max_results=100, fields="Standard",
order_by="", params="", coordsys='equatorial|galactic', equinox="2000|1950", GIFsize=0

where "parameter=XX" means that it is optional and defaults to XX value.
Required parameters are "table" and "position". Position may be given
as name of the source or as coordinate string (standard heasarc
conventions). List of tables and their descriptions may be obtained at

http://heasarc.nasa.gov/db-perl/W3Browse/w3catindex.pl
** note that pdf output uses latex, so pdflatex and several commonly installed
packages have to be available

Optional arguments are specified as -argument value. See couple of examples below:
1)To create a pdf with table listing all X-ray pulsars which exhibit a Cyclotron line in their spectra,
ordered py spin period use:
./browse_extract.py hmxbcat "GX 301-2" -radius 1e8 -params "xray_type=*C*" -fields "name,ra,dec,porb,pulse_per" -order_by pulse_per -out pdf="test.pdf"

2)To display on screen observation ids,exposure and PI name for  Crab observations by RXTE in 2007 type

./browse_extract.py xtemaster Crab -fields "obsid,exposure,pi_lname" -order_by exposure -time "2007-01-01..2007-12-31" -params='exposure>0' -out text_table
